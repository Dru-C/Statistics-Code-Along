# Statistics-Code-Along
Intended to refresh and tune up python and mathematics skills, also learn a bit of latex and github


Self learning project.  I am going through the Khan Academy Statistics course as a refresher and I am creating some simple programs and simulations to help reinfore the material and tune up my python as I go.  Additionally I am looking forward to learning some latex and Github in the process.
